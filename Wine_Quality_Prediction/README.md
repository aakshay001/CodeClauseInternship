#  Wine Quality Prediction

## Description

* For Wine Quality Prediction, I have used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “Good Quality” or not. 
* Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 8. 
* For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “Good Quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7).
* Here I have used ``Random Forest Algorithm`` to create my prediction model.
